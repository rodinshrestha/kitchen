                    <p>In the late nineties, co-owners Kam Chhiring and Ngima Sherpa moved to California and found a home in the heart of Sonoma Valley. Both worked their way up through the restaurant industry starting as bussers and ending as entrepreneurs. In 1997 Kam opened his first restaurant which he named Himalayan Sherpa Cuisine in Glen Ellen, and Ngima spent years managing Meritage Martini and Oyster Bar right off the Sonoma square where he went on years later to open Sonoma Grille in the same location. Their business partnership stemmed friendshp. They came from Nepal with nothing but the American dream and went on to become critical components of their community.</p>

                    <p>Food is at the heart of the human experience. Everyone eats, and the experience should be an enjoyable one. With this in mind, Ngima and Kam decided to bring a taste of Nepal to Main Street in  St. Helena. There was no promise of success as most of St. Helena’s restaurants fall under French and Italian influence. A Nepalese place would be out of the norm but the quaint location excited the pair and on May 29, 2012, Himalayan Sherpa Kitchen opened its doors to the public, and it has been a fantastic adventure ever since.</p>

                    <p>Himalayan Sherpa has become a staple in the St. Helena community. Whether it’s a place to catch up with old friends, have a casual dinner out with the family or to grab a quick lunch before work. Locals refer to the chicken tikka masala as a drug they have no hopes of quitting. They feel blessed to be able to be a part of such a wonderful community. Feel free to visit Kam at Himalayan Sherpa Kitchen’s sister restaurant Yak & Yeti in Napa or Ngima at Sonoma Grille in Sonoma.</p>

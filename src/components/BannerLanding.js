            In the late nineties, owners Kam Chhiring moved to California and
            found a home in the heart of Sonoma Valley. In 1997 Kam opened his
            first restaurant which he named Himalayan Sherpa Cuisine in Glen
            Ellen.

            Food is at the heart of the human experience. Everyone eats, and the
            experience should be an enjoyable one. With this in mind, Himalayan
            Sherpa Kitchen was born. There was no promise of success as most of
            St. Helena’s restaurants fall under French and Italian influence. A
            Nepalese place would be out of the norm but the quaint location
            excited the pair and on May 29, 2012, Himalayan Sherpa Kitchen
            opened its doors to the public, and it has been a fantastic
            adventure ever since.

            Himalayan Sherpa has become a staple in the St. Helena community.
            Whether it’s a place to catch up with old friends, have a casual
            dinner out with the family or to grab a quick lunch before work.
            Locals refer to the chicken tikka masala as a drug they have no
            hopes of quitting. They feel blessed to be able to be a part of such
            a wonderful community.
